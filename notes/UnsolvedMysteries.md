# Things that I would like to refactor if I could figure out how

### For adding things to firestore, I had to use a form with a submit button in order to call the function addFileToFirestore.  Otherwise there is a warning that "objects are not valid as a React child."

### I would prefer to not use a button, is there a component I could put it inside of rather than a form?
