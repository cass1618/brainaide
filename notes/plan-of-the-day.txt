1. Start building out React structure for main page
2. Integrate ScraperAPI into React
3. Start figuring out how to parse the data


Currently trying to get the url entered in a form into React.  I am struggling a bit because before, I would add a new object to a list.  Currently all I'm trying to do is set one single url.  

. . . although I suppose if the user could store multiple URLs that would be ideal.
