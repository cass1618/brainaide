Name of Project: Read Easier

Project's Purpose or Goal: This project will make it easier for people who have difficulty focusing on regular text by adding random fonts and colors to keep the brain occupied and allowing the user to focus.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: 1. Will be able to load text from a file
2. Will be able to separate the text into sections and randomly alter the display

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
So far I plan on using the curl API in order to extract text from a webpage.  I will then need to figure out how to separate the actual text from the html.
I plan on using React and if possible I'd like to use Angular.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
1. Add an adjustable timer that makes a sound at intervals to keep track of passing time
2. Tell the user to take breaks or do random activities
3. Be able to extract text from a webpage or PDF
4. Allow space for the user to take notes or type what they are reading
5 Provide customizable settings to change what types of fonts, colors, etc they would like to use

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
I will need to be able to use curl and something that makes sounds (guess I better hurry up and research this ðŸ˜¬)

So what I actually want to do is have the user enter a url and extract the text from that site.  I have been experimenting with ScraperAPI and I am able to get the html from that.  I'd like to figure out how to extract the text/images from the html file so that I can then display the text reformatted on my app.  So this is actually a big part of what I want to do.  However if I am having too much trouble I will do the copy-paste thing.

I would like the text to be separated by sentences/paragraphs and only display a small amount at a time.  The user would be able to use the up and down arrows to show the next or previous sections.  I think I might have a randomizer button, so if you don't like how the current text is displayed you can keep clicking the button until you like what you are looking at.

So I'm thinking MVP would be scrape a website, display it on my page, style it in some way, and provide a way for the user to navigate through the text and change the style.

I would like to try to use some React but I imagine I'll use a decent amount of jQuery as well.
