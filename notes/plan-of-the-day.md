Currently trying to get the url entered in a form into React.  I am struggling a bit because before, I would add a new object to a list.  Currently all I'm trying to do is set one single url.  


. . . although I suppose if the user could store multiple URLs that would be ideal.


Sunday July 18
1. Update the API so that the user can enter the url and it will be loaded
1. Figure out how to apply CSS styles to the displayed page
1. Split paragraphs up and add id's so they can each be styled differently
1. Create a function that will randomly select a font and color


Monday July 19
## API call was working before.  Now I need to figure out how to call the function from App Control.

Form for entering URL
url value is collected from form
api call is made using the url
html file is returned
file is added to firestore
