Not really an error but, I noticed that if I click the submit button within the first couple seconds, it stores the placeholder array in firestore.  So I guess I need to make it wait until the API is done before storing it

1. install html-to-react and use parser

## Side error
* did not recognize type of html-to-react
=> Added types/index.d.ts and added types to tsconfig.json

=> Added parser to FileDisplay and removed table nodes
No noted side effects
